3.1
	There is a `=` that should be a `+=`
	Instead of adding to the amount of FGEN that has been commited, it just overwrites the previous committed amount
	Recommendation
		Change the `=` to a `+=`
3.2
	The GenesisGroup related stuff is only for people who are here for the beginning launch
	But you can still call `GenesisGroup.purchase` and `GenesisGroup.commit` 
	Recommendation
		Make sure these can't be called after launch
