we all know that we're here for the

launch of the security bootcamp smart

contract auditing

epoch zero launch

uh

funded by the ethereum foundation grant

and uh sponsor partners consensus

diligence sigma prime and trailer bits

thank you all for making this happen and

really a big thanks

to the ethereum foundation for the grant

and for the sponsored partners without

which this may have taken a very

different form

but i think uh the biggest thanks goes

to really all the participants

um without whom

you know this wouldn't have happened

so thanks for joining guys and uh and

everyone

so let's get

started so securium um

is really very simple right it is

security and ethereum are the two words

put together

and the idea was

really to further improve the state of

security on ethereum

and

in this case

it's really application security that we

are looking at so smart contact security

specifically for ethereum

and it's always been

a primary concern

and

there are many many approaches to

solving it many efforts and initiatives

and security wanted to also play a role

and

you know do something uh to raise the

bar to help this uh effort right so that

is really

the

mission of security

and to step back um

there are

you know for people coming in from

security um

there are many tools many different

techniques that are used in security as

we know

but in specifically in the case of smart

contracts um there are many many tools

and

you know a lot of the

firms a lot of sponsoring partners

and others have written fantastic tools

our writing is being researched and

being worked on

but still i think it is uh you know fair

to say that a significant effort of

smart contract security auditing is

still manual right and that's just

because of where we are in uh you know

in this timeline

we are still very very early a lot of

things are changing ethereum protocol

itself is changing as we know um the

languages are

improving solidity which is by far the

most widely used language uh there are

many releases every year one almost

every month or two right

so

there are all these tools and techniques

that are trying to keep up

and the one thing constant is really the

manual effort right

so the people who are involved in the

space are

trying to use some of these tools and

techniques and complement their blind

spots or shortcomings by using manual

analysis so this is um a significant i

mean this plays a very significant role

in smart contract security smart contact

auditing right today

and that is sort of the primary focus

and

that sort of is a problem because as we

know manual efforts don't scale very

well right so they have i mean they have

a very high degree of

accuracy

they have very low false positive rate i

mean these are all typically speaking

compared to the tools definitely in the

web 3 space in the healing space

but

we

don't scale as well as the tools right

we're not very deterministic right

and we can't really sort of uh

be looking at smart contract auditing or

security 24 7 365

ci cd all these things that are so

elegantly and efficiently done with

tools are not

as easy to do with

manual analysis right so that is

that is a challenge

and the reason why it's a challenge is

because of this security pyramid

right

so if you look at this

it's fair to say that we have billions

of dollars of value right

on ethereum both the ethereum protocol

itself and all the other protocols that

are built on top of it

all this value that is captured in these

protocols and there are hundreds of

thousands of them at this point

all that responsibility for the security

of those protocols is being shouldered

by only hundreds of experts

so this difference in magnitude is

is

so stark right compared to web 2

for all you know for all of you who have

been in the type 2 space who are still

in the web 2 space in the security space

this will be like uh

amazing um you know

a difference that you will see is that

there are very few people right and

understandably so who are quote-unquote

experts at ethereum security

and the reasons are again understandable

um

because in order to do security or smart

contracts you need to know i mean we

need to know

security right and how that works and

that itself there is like 40 50 years

worth of

research and information security a lot

of which still applies to web3 to

ethereum

besides that we need to understand how

blockchain works we need to understand

specifically how gdm works we need to

understand um you know we need to master

solidity language

not from a developer perspective but

from a security perspective right we

need to understand

the bits and the bytes of the byte code

of the higher level language and many

many aspects

that

that play a huge role in this so that is

the challenge

and that is really the mission

that

the community is trying to address right

which is to

train experts train people to become

security experts in this space

this has to

go up from hundreds to really thousands

because it's not you know it's not just

a smart contract

security firms or teams that want to

hire and work with such experts people

who understand this

but

every protocol the thousands of

protocols every one of them will very

soon need a security person on their

team so that they don't have to rely on

a third-party firm to do security for

them because that again is not uh you

know it's not practical it's not

scalable right so that is the magnitude

of the challenge that we are looking at

so it's a huge challenge but

uh just like with any huge challenge

it's also a huge opportunity for all of

us here

so that is what we are addressing with

this mission

so that is really the focus the primary

focus of

securing boot camp and smart contract

security on a day for the etheleum

ecosystem

and again

funded by the ethereum foundation grant

sponsor partners without who and without

all of you this would not have been

possible so thank you so that is really

the motivation and the background for

both securium as well as

the need for

a boot camp

such as the one that is going to start

all right um so let's step back and sort

of

recall why we are doing this again right

we're here to learn specifically about

smart content security auditing

for for folks for people who are

interested in smart contact development

this might be interesting because they

can increase their security jobs their

security understanding but the focus of

this boot camp is really really going to

be on

security auditing right and we'll talk

more about

the the difference in uh the mindset and

difference in so many things

that apply specifically to smart

contract auditing that necessarily do

not apply to smart contact development

so that i think is is something that i

would like to stress upon for the

duration and

this is also about helping people

make the leap from web 2 to web 3.

and this this is obvious we talked about

this

i want uh

again you know rehash it

and this is also about helping people

who are developers in the web 3 space

change their development or

you know add to their development

mindset at security

mindset to that

frame of mind right and this again is is

a big mindset that um you know that you

will see as we go through the boot camp

because uh instead of looking at more

efficient ways of writing or developing

code we'll be looking at things that

might actually uh go against it right

that hey

maybe this is more efficient but this is

not

a best practice from a security

perspective so things like that so that

mindset change is

something critical and hopefully we will

talk more about that switch as well

and the last two points are things we

talked about so the higher order goal

here is to really scale ethereum

security and to grow this uh vibrant

community so for folks for people who

are uh sort of getting into the space

now uh it's it's a really an amazing

place to be in uh very helpful all

around um so we all want to help each

other and we all want to sort of grow

together right so yeah welcome uh

everyone to this community

and let's get into some of the specifics

um this is again this nothing here

should be very new so this is a

three-month boot camp starting today

october

and uh going on till end of december and

uh even after that the details of which

will be shared uh later on

and this is

i mean uh who doesn't love free so this

is a free boot camp uh again thanks to

the ethereum foundation and the sponsors

for making that possible so uh that was

uh you know one of the biggest reasons

why we were able to accommodate um as

many people as we are able to do at this

point in time so the focus again is

ethereum's about contact security

auditing right

and this is uh

goes back again to the ethereum culture

of being very open

the boot camp is

being opened

is open will be open to

students to professionals to beginners

to experts

um and finally speaking i i don't think

there are any uh you know expert sort of

uh

set in stone here because this space is

moving you know so fast that you take a

weekend off and uh you know you're

already uh two days or two months behind

uh all the things that have happened

right so

uh everyone is learning here so i don't

think there's uh there are people who

will spend more time so maybe have a bit

more context so

feel free

to not think of uh you know let's not

think of anyone as a beginner or an

expert in this case

and you should also be conscious of

people joining

part-time and full-time there's a boot

camp there is an expectation of spending

quite a bit of time and effort but we

wanted to be open to people who can only

afford a few hours a day

so um so it does it has been done and i

believe there are many of us who are

doing this uh on nights and weekends

right so um

you know everyone as well

and this is again web 2 and web 3 so

we'll see people who have talked to you

about ethereum which is fine you'll see

people who are experts in um well who

spent a lot of time in bethlehem so for

such people please you know help out

others is a sincere request

also um

there will be some of us who understand

security more and there will be people

who understand programming in general

you know we are programmed a good

programming in terms of languages uh

what have you right so really an open

culture open to everyone so let's please

be accommodating um you know on the

discord channel to everyone who comes in

and might seem to ask a question that is

obvious to some of us but uh really i

mean you know it could be a very genuine

question that they're not uh

familiar with so that is a sincere

interest

and how are we going to do this um there

is uh there are two phases um so i think

in the interest of time i promised

to

finish this very soon but um let's run

past this

one phase october november readings

videos quizzes and more

10 to 20 hours a week is sort of uh

minimum requirement

uh in in my mind

just in terms of

you know if you want to do well if you

want to understand well uh learn well i

think that is

the number of hours that

one might have to put in uh but if you

you know if you can spend only a

hours than than what is required then

the structure of the boot camp is such

that uh you know you will be able to

make up later on right so

i'll talk more about it when we get to

the quizzes

then uh december is going to be ordered

readiness i mean this is where uh

rubber meets the road uh if you will so

all the learnings for the first two

months in october and november

we all well whoever gets selected based

on the quizzes will get into the audit

readiness phase and they will get to

evaluate the projects and for those who

could not make it there will be other

opportunities after that right so the

details of which i'll be sharing later

on

um more details

so this i think is uh interesting

there are eight weeks in the learn phase

and every week there will be one article

that will be shared on substance right

and if you don't know what this uh you

know what some of these mean um

i will be sharing more details on

discord uh so

nothing to worry about that

and

that article

uh will be accompanied by five videos

that will be shared on youtube right

so both sub stack as well as you know

the article on subset and the youtube

videos are going to be publicly

available to everyone who is uh you know

who's part of the boot camp or not

doesn't matter this will be publicly

available that is again one of the goals

is to make learning accessible to

everyone um

so that is a good thing

and what will not be available to

everyone will be available only to those

who have registered for this boot camp

are the quizzes

so every week there's going to be one

quiz which will be

shared on the class marker

platform and this is uh

you know something that you should be

familiar with

there was a readiness quiz uh sort of

shared a week earlier

so this um i mean

we can talk more about that later but

these are sort of the platforms that

we'll be using for this bootcamp right

and all these links will be sent out in

an email

every week

approximately well this will be sunday

uh to me sir sending out um but

depending on where you are it might be

saturday night or it might be an early

monday but you can expect to get one

email

every week

that gives links to all these three

things with an article to the five

videos and to the quiz

so i would recommend

uh you know

not skipping the article and just uh

watching the videos i would recommend uh

you know

doing both in parallel uh if you can and

the five videos

are sort of split out uh very neatly um

and i'll share more details on the

discord in the interest of time

so

for people who are

you know

who learn visually

or by listening uh looking at videos

feel free to watch the videos but also

simultaneously look at the article for

people like me for example i prefer

reading articles um so i i would

recommend reading that article and

reading is really really good because as

a security smart contact security

auditor you are going to be reading a

lot a lot of code right so that is

an extra benefit of

or a side effect of this

so any questions of this

on any of these details please feel free

to ask on the questions channel on

discord

and i'll jump ahead

so

chris i think

you know all of us or

many of us are sort of uh

excited about the quizzes just some of

us are worried about the quiz but um

let's talk about it

every quiz

is going to have either 32 questions

16 questions or eight questions right

and there will be eight quizzes one

every week some some of the initial ones

will have 32

um because

it just makes sense and later on when it

when every question needs more time

what i've done what we have done is

reduce the number of questions but all

quizzes

have

a fixed time of 16 minutes so if you see

this pattern there's all powers of two

this is sort of a fun way to break away

from the decimal system and deal with

binary which is uh really you know the

bits and bytes that we're going to be

dealing with

so 16 minutes for a request 32 questions

or 16 or eight and you'll know this um

you know in the email there'll be a lot

of uh there will be any surprises

hopefully

and for every quiz for taking the quiz

on the class marker platform

we will need an access code

which has been shared with all of you in

an email right so please

uh keep that access code handy because

you will need to enter that that's the

only way you know you will be able to

enter into the quiz platform and only

way that i will know who's because this

is

then you will be asked for your discord

handle so if there is somebody on this

call who still uh has not joined the

discord server for securian please

please join that you will uh i mean it

will make our lives easier if there are

any sort of troubleshooting uh to be

done and you will also be requested to

enter the email id that you registered

or signed up for this bootcamp right all

these three things will

be required for every quest so please

keep them handy

quizzes are single attempt

so you get only one chance to

do the quiz right there is no pause and

resume right after a few questions or

whatever

we won't be allowed to pause the quiz go

back take a break and uh you know resume

it later that is not allowed

so these two things please keep in mind

so please

start the quiz

only once you have uh you know once you

walk through the content the article in

the videos once you are

fairly certain that

you know that you're ready for the quiz

and make sure that your internet

connection whatever else your laptops

everything else is in top shape because

uh

this

is

you know they won't uh it's not

practical

enough to make exceptions

because

um it's well

you you probably understand that right

we are

going to have hundreds 500 or a thousand

people doing this and there is really no

way to scale for myself to scale myself

to clone myself to

to do any of that right

so please please

remember this single attempt no pause

resume take the quiz

it's not i mean the quiz is going to be

very straightforward so no stress but

just make sure these two things are

remembered

and every quiz

will have two weeks time to finish right

so if you get the email on sunday

we have two weeks

to

um

read the content to you know to sort of

master it and then take the quiz

but ideally try to finish it in that one

week because the following sunday you're

gonna get another email with the next

week's content and a second quiz right

or the third quiz so

just make sure you pace yourself but the

two weeks time was uh

really to

give a bit of grace period uh for

you know somebody who is working for

somebody who's traveling you know all

the other interruptions uh that we have

in life right so that is really um the

idea of quizzes and again

no exceptions please

all right some more

details on the quiz

every question and

i've tried

we have tried to keep this very

straightforward

every question is is a multiple choice

it will have

i mean it's a multiple choice there are

no

you know answers to be written or typed

out because it's not practical for uh

for me to really uh look at so many

answers and evaluate it so they're all

multiple choice however

we also want to make it

you know you want to keep the bar high

so that

people really master the content before

they can

you know before they can ace the quizzes

right so these multiple choice questions

have four check boxes they are not radio

buttons so it's not like every question

has only one answer that potentially

allows somebody to guess and you know

get it right there are four check boxes

which means that

every question can have

one or more correct answers so there can

be one correct answer two three or all

four could be correct and

you get

one point for answering your question

only if you answer all the correct

answers and only the correct answers

so example

you have choices a b c and d and let's

say that the correct answers are b and d

right

so you will get one point only if you

choose b and d as the correct answers in

the check boxes if you choose

a b and

um sorry what did i say uh yeah b and c

right so b and c are the correct answers

so if you choose a b and c

you will get zero points because your

chosen a which is not one of the correct

answers if you choose only b you'll

still get zero points there are no

partial points because both b and c are

correct right so

one question one point

only if you get all and only the correct

answers and there are no partial points

there are no negative points you get a

question wrong

you get zero there are no negative

points

so the questions are by design right

tricky

what we have tried to do is to make them

as unambiguous as possible

however

we want to keep them tricky to make sure

that you understand we understand the

nuances of ethereum or solidity security

anything that is being tested upon

yeah

so please read all the questions very

carefully there are some questions that

might ask you

uh things like which of the following

are true

there might be some questions that ask

you which are which are the following

are false

so

make sure you see the true and false and

answer appropriately

so this is something we will try to

reduce confusion as much as possible

but on the flip side

as auditors

we need to pay attention to every letter

to every word right and

there will be

uh you know the time bounded aspect of

yes this is 16 minutes so there will be

the time pressure but so is auditing and

jocelyn who's here we'll talk more about

that at the end of this call but

this is you know these quizzes are also

reflective of uh sort of the life of an

auditor right it is going to be

time-bound it is going to be tricky it

is going to be ambiguous it is not going

to be crystal clear because if that were

to be the case then security would be

very easy but that is not the case yeah

so please read carefully

and

again in the interest of

people taking the quizzes at different

points different time zones at different

times

these quizzes

as soon as you finish a quiz

you will not know the correct answers

what will happen is you will receive an

email from class marker to the

registered email id you will receive an

email that tells

you how many points you're scored right

out of 32 questions 16 or 8. how many

points

so that is all you will know

and at the end of two weeks

from when it was shared once the quiz

closes at that point

i will be sharing the correct answers

and at that point

you know we would really encourage

everyone to discuss the answers to break

it down uh to see why you know why it is

uh it makes sense or maybe there are uh

questions and answers that are not very

clear

so this is something hopefully we can

get right in the second iteration right

so we are going through a lot of effort

and again i would like to call out

jocelyn and

some of the other folks who have helped

with

shaping up these quizzes to keep them

unambiguous as much as possible but

really to raise the bar so that they

really test all of us and make sure that

we have mastered uh the content as much

as we can

so i think this is probably the slide

that i spent the most time on but that

is because this is

going to be critical in determining who

will make it to the

audit readiness phase which i know that

a lot of you are very uh excited about

so i think

with that we

have at least i have covered a lot of

what i wanted to talk about

so

again welcome to the security security

boot camp on smart contract security

auditing this is really about ethereum

about educating ourselves about

evaluating the security of the various

things that we see in this space so

let's yes let us learn let's try to

master the content let's uh learn from

each other let's ask a lot of questions

at the same time let's also be

considerate of uh you know other

people's time and effort and the

channels of communication so please uh

look at the channels see if your

questions have already been asked

discard now probably not

the best channel but really uh

all we have so look up maybe at some

point we'll have an faq but see if your

questions have been asked

join jump into those discussions create

threads

and let's let's all learn together and

more importantly

because we are coming in from so many

different backgrounds so many different

contexts with different expertise

different experience which is what makes

this community you know which will make

this community really

exciting is

our intention and our efforts in helping

others learn so i would really really

request and encourage everybody to help

others learn

there might be things that are very

obvious straightforward to

me that might you know be really hard

for someone else so please be

open-minded please be generous with your

time your words and uh yeah at the end

of the day

uh let's let's not get too stressed out

there will be many opportunities this is

just the beginning uh there is you know

huge

uh you know cute challenge a lot of

opportunities and let's let's have

fun in learning right so that is that is

i think really critical

and i've been told that

we can't have fun

especially at a launch event like this

without

you know having a pro-app

so

yes we do have a poet and for people who

know what a product is um

you know

there will be a pro-app that should hit

your email inboxes

maybe in 12 to 18 hours and for people

who aren't aware it is

think of it as a badge

it's a proof of attendance protocol it

shows i mean it shows on the blockchain

like an nfp that in this case you did

attend this um

you know this launch event and in this

case again

we are being open you're not restricting

or sharing your code right now it will

be in your email

and um uh you know

it will also be emailed inboxes of

people who could not join this meeting

and uh i heard a few more things people

are gonna try to get in uh to this

meeting after uh i stopped

having a chance to admit them in so

everyone who is registered

look take a look at your email inboxes

uh give it you know give it today and

you will have a po app called

all right so i think that officially

qualifies us as uh having fun

uh with the app

so uh so yeah so please stay tuned there

is uh the twitter handles here

there is uh

i mean twitter again we will use well i

will use it sparingly

only for official public announcements

but

really the main

sort of

watering hole if you will

where all of us

are already there all of us

need to be there and a lot of people who

are even outside of the boot camp um

have joined the discord server so please

please join the discord server which is

where

you know all of us are going to be

learning for the next three months and

beyond so with that yes let's uh let's

go
