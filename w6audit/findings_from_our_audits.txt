Most impactful results from analysis
	SC vulns are more like vulns in other systems that is commonly expected
	80% of the most important flaws could likely be detected with automated static or dynamic analysis
	50% of all findings are not likely to ever be found by any automated tools (even if the tech gets way better)
	Manually produced extensive unit tests likely offer weak or no protection against flaws that an expect auditor can find
Most of the literature on SC vulns focuses on only a few but not all
	EG reentrancy is something you hear a lot about
Category frequencies
	Data validation flaws are extremely common (36% of SC findings, 53% of non SC findings)
	Access control (10% of findings)
Worst of the worst
	A worst finding is HIGH severity, LOW difficulty
	<category> <percentage of found vulns being HIGHLOW
	Access control 25%
	Authentication 25%
	Timing 25%
	Numerics 23%
	Undefined behaviour 23%
	Data validation 11%
	Patching 11%
Tools and automation: No silver bullet
	50% of the finding were almost impossible to detect with a tool
	Tool can't inform you about (most) frontrunning
	There are problems that simply require human effort
Unit tests are great but maybe not for this
	There was not any correlation between unit test quantity/quality and presence of findings
	Unit tests are still important, but what it means is that what devs who write unit tests are looking for vs auditors is diff
