GET YOUR MIND RIGHT
	Audit is to get other eyes on program and increase confidence that project works how you want it to
	Reasons to engage in audit
		Lack in-house expertise
		Lack licensing to tools
		High risk contract 
		Seeking input
		Risks that need to be mitigated
		Oppornunities to improve architecture for security/auditability
	Does not guarantee code quality/security or stamp of approval
	Avoid the mentality of audits for marketing
	Just typically makes higher quality code and assurance levels increase

VENDOR EXPERTISE
	Vendors typically have specific specialties they excel in
	Available staff, professionalism and prev experience will affect outcome of assessment
	A leading vendor in UX should not be expected to give leading reviews on distributed infrastructure architecture

AVAILABLE VENDOR RESOURCES
	The resources the vendor is able to assign to the audit
	Refers to man-power, available tooling, computer resources etc
	Can all affect how the audit goes

AVAILABLE DOCUMENTATION
	Quality documentation is helpful for assessors
	They need to learn from nothing to everything in the assessement time so the easier it is the better so money is spent well

PRIOR ART
	The number of known issues with code/technology/functionality being assessed
	Known issues in the past can help paint a picture of the project and where to look
	If relatively new project, then stuff may be found during the audit

HOW TO PREPARE
	DOCUMENTATION
		Explicit detailed documentation allows outsiders to understand functionality easily
		Describe how to interact with it
		Objective is to get auditor to go from zero knowledge to master asap
		Have exhaustive user stories
		Perform threat modelling
			Look at things through the eyes of an attacker
			Where an attacker would start etc
	TEST IT YOURSELF
		Perform user stories
		Break away from the norm user stories and do unusual things
	CREATE A TESTING CORPUS
		... not really sure what those are ...
	USE AUTOMATED TESTING
		Pretty self-explanatory, using fuzzers etc

STEPS TO AN ASSESSMENT
	SHOULD YOU EVEN GET AUDIT
		How much risk is in the system
		How complex is the system
		How much does the assessment cost relative to the value or risk the system will hold
		What is the potential cost of system failure
	DEFINE THE SCOPE
		Define where the auditors should look
		Narrow down areas in the codebase that need extra scrutiny
	HAVE A BUDGET PREPARED
		Prices can fluctuate
		Have funds basically
	WRITE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) DOCUMENT
		You bring it all tegother into a single document to send out
		Should contain
			Intro					.
			Project description			.
			Resources				docs/spec
			Scope					.
			Engagement Description			.
			Deliverables				what you expect as a result of assessment
			Indemnification and fee structure	how are people getting paid
			Selection criteria			what you are looking for in an external assessment org
			Bidding instructions			how one goes about submitting a proposal
			Conclusion				.
	SET UP CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION
		You need to be able to communicate with the project team
		Communication channel should be secure

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A SECURITY VENDOR
	Some are outstanding, some good, some bad, some should shut down
	They all vary with their associated costs
	Use the responses to your RFP and then look into each company
	The vendors proposal should show they have expertise in the specific technologies in the scope of the project
	A track record of previous assessments that are available for review can be useful
	Vendor should have rationale behind their fee structure
	If vendor can not justify the price behind their proposal then ignore it
	
HOW TO MAXIMISE RESULTS
	You now have a set of deliverables to go through that you requested in the RFP
	You have to address whatever was found by the audit team
	Once fixed you should broadcast the mitigations made
