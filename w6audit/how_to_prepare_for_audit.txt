When broken down there are 6 steps to follow to get the best out of an audit
	1) Documentation
	2) Clean code
	3) Testing
	4) Automated analysis
	5) Frozen code
	6) Use a checklist
	The following will break each point down in more detail

DOCUMENTATION
	Good documentation makes it easier to understand the project and get into deep analysis
	Describe 'what' and 'why' its being built (for the overall project and each contract)
	Include a specification of the systems indended functionality
		For each contract describe important properties or behaviours as well as actions/states that should not be possible
	Flow charts go a long way too
	Pseudocode spec is decent as it's explained in English so it more clearly expresses what you want the code to do
CLEAN CODE
	Well formatted code is easier to read
	Run a linter on your code
	Address compiler warnings
	Remove comments that indicate unfinished work (TODO/FIXME)
	Remove commented-out code
	Remove unneeded code
TESTING
	Goal is to have 100% test coverage
	Review list of test cases for gaps
	Sometimes tests are made to make sure the 'happy path' works out but not any other cases
	README should have clear indicator on how to use tests
AUTOMATED ANALYSIS
	Running simpler tests before audit and addressing them leaves auditors with more time to focus on complex stuff
	Can use something like MythX suite as a start
	Not essential to do this but it helps
FROZEN CODE
	Development should be finished before audit starts
	You typically will give a commit hash for auditors to work on
	Don't try to make changes to code while audit happening cause it's a waste of time
USE A CHECKLIST
	Here is a simple one
	--------------------
	Documentation (plain english description of project, what and why)
		For overall system
		For each contract
	Clean code
		Run linter
		Fix compiler warnings
		Remove TODO and FIXME comments
		Delete unused code
	Testing
		README gives clear instructions for running tests
		Testing dependencies are packaged with the code OR are listed including versions
	Automated analysis
		Analysis with MythX
		Or other tools
	Frozen code
		Halt development of the contract code
		Provide commit hash for the audit to target
